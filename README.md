# Rounding-to-significant-digit
Rounding of uncertainties and measurement values to significant digit as specified by DIN1333

This is an Excel macro written in VBA.

NOTE: I will make a guide on how to use this macro. Also, I have some ideas on how to hopefully improve the code - it should remove the need for a lot of the if-clauses. That being said, the code as of now works (to my knowledge), even if it ain't pretty! The next update will hopefully be in maybe 2-3 months, I'm just a bit busy with other stuff right now.
